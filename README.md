## Tecnologies

This application was developed using a cross-platform framework that allows multi-operanting systems support namely iOS and Android:

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) cross-platform framework 
- [Tensorflow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) used to integrate machine learning models into mobile applications

## How to run

As a requirement, it is necessary to have Flutter already installed. To run the mobile application:

1. Get flutter dependencies:

```
flutter pub get
```

2. After mobile device connected, run the application doing:

```
flutter run
```

This [article](https://carolinamalbuquerque.medium.com/audio-recognition-using-tensorflow-lite-in-flutter-application-8a4ad39964ae) explores not only how this app was developed but also how to prepare both environments (Android and iOS) for the Tensorflow Lite.
